* Numbered headings
* Automatic table of contents
* Citing and generation of bibliography from BibTeX files
* Footnotes
* Code highlighting
* Figure / Table numbering
* Internally referencing chapters and figures
* Abbreviations
* Splitting the content into pages
* Including content from other files
* +more
