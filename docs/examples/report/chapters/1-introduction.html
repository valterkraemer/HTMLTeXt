<h1>Introduction</h1>

<abbr>LaTeX</abbr> is often used when creating scientific papers for multiple reasons including that it is free, separates content from style, flexibility and good at referencing. <abbr>LaTeX</abbr> however also have some drawbacks – a big one being the learning curve. It can take a long time to get familiar to it, and even though a good template helps a lot, if the user needs to make a specific layout change it can get very complex. Another drawback is its size: for example the recommended <abbr>LaTeX</abbr> version for MacOS is MacTeX (17 April 2018) which weighs in at 3.42GB. This version includes a huge set of functionalities that a normal user never uses.

The goal of this project is to allow users to create scientific papers using <abbr>HTML</abbr> as markup language. <abbr>HTML</abbr> already supports many of <abbr>LaTeX</abbr>’s most common features, such as headings, including images, tables and lists. This project will supply the user with the missing essential features to allow users with <abbr>HTML</abbr> knowledge to write scientific papers using familiar elements and style it using <abbr>CSS</abbr>.

<h2 style="break-before: page">History</h2>

I got the idea for this project when writing my Bachelor's thesis in 2014 because <abbr>LaTeX</abbr> felt overkill and confusing for writing a simple text document – especially when I needed to change the styling. Half a year later the first commit<footnote><url>https://github.com/valterkraemer/Angular-Typer/commit/c38e3fc878a697c7c47ad6dd900f99c67a45db08</url></footnote> to GitHub was pushed for the project AngularTyper<footnote><url>https://github.com/valterkraemer/Angular-Typer</url></footnote>, the project was developed to provide the features missing in HTML to allow users to write documents similar to my Batchelor's thesis in HTML. As the name says, it uses AngularJS<footnote><url>https://angularjs.org</url></footnote> under the hood.

One and a half year later in 2016 I started a similar project from scratch called VaType<footnote><url>https://github.com/valterkraemer/VaType</url></footnote>. The objective was to create a more modular and extendable version that didn't rely on AngularJS and timeouts.

<h2>HTMLTeXt</h2>

HTMLTeXt, the project this report is tells about, is yet another project that does somewhat the same thing as the ones mentioned earlier, but in a totally new fashion and with more features. Some of its new features are: footnotes, templates, hooks, and better browser compatibility.

This report is written using HTMLTeXt.
