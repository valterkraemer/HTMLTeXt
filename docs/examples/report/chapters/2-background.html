<h2>Web standards</h2>

There are a couple of interesting <abbr>W3C</abbr><footnote><url>https://www.w3.org</url></footnote> Working Drafts related to this project that are presented in this section.

<h3>CSS Regions</h3>

<i>CSS Regions</i> allows content to flow between multiple elements<cite>W3CRegions</cite>. This would be useful, every page would be a region, so the content could flow between them. Browser support is however not good: currently, only Edge has basic support, and both Chrome and Safari have removed their support.

<h3 ref="css-paged-media">CSS Paged Media</h3>

The <abbr>W3C</abbr> working drafts </footnote> <i>CSS Paged Media</i> and <i>CSS Generated Content for Paged Media</i> are really interesting for this project. They add functionality for pagination, page margins, page size, page counter, headers, footers and much more <cite>W3CPagedMedia,W3CCGC</cite>. However, browsers are only supporting a small subset of their features.

There are multiple tools that will allow you to create <abbr>PDF</abbr> documents from HTML and CSS that also have implemented many of the features introduced in Section <ref>css-paged-media</ref> CSS Paged Media. Here are the most common ones:

<ul>
  <li><b>Prince:</b> Prince<footnote><url>https://www.princexml.com</url></footnote> is the most commonly referenced one in articles about printed media by using HTML and CSS in my experience. It costs US$495 for a personal license.</li>

  <li><b>PDFreactor:</b> PDFreactor<footnote><url>https://www.pdfreactor.com</url></footnote> is another commonly used one. A license costs 2680â‚¬.</li>

  <li><b>Vivliostyle.js:</b> Vivliostyle.js<footnote><url>https://vivliostyle.org</url></footnote> is an interesting open source project. According to themselves, Vivliostyle <i>enhances typography and layout capability of web browsers, to be used as typesetting engines for both web/digital and print publishing</i><cite>Vivliostyle</cite>. They however lack good documentation.</li>
</ul>
