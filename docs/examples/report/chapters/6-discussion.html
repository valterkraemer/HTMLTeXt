<h1>Limitations and Future work</h1>

LaTeX have a huge set of functionalities and the goal of this project is not to implement all of them. But a couple more common ones would be good.

Some shortcuts were taken during implementation that currently works well â€“ but can lead to problems in the future. Refactoring the codebase would be good to improve extendability and modifications.

Using <code>clientRect</code> on Text Nodes would eliminate the need for splitting Text Nodes using <code>scrollTop = clientHeight</code> that could improve performance.

While writing this document, one feature I am especially missing: avoiding splitting text between text and footnote/citation. And also not making page breaks directly after a heading.

It would also be good to investigate if Vivliostyle could be used together with this project. Then Vivliostyle could take care of things like positioning headers, footers and splitting the pages.
