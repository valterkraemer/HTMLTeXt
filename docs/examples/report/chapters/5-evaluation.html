<h1>Evaluation</h1>

The goal of this project was to allow users to create scientific papers using <abbr>HTML</abbr>. And to prove that it is possible using this library I transformed my whole Master's thesis to use HTMLTeXt. The version produced by HTMLTeXt looks so similar to the one produced by LaTeX that I often mistook which one was produced by which. If I now would write my Thesis again I would use this Library!

An aspect for comparison is the produced file size. It turned out to be a big difference from what browser and how the <abbr>PDF</abbr> was exported. When exporting my Thesis the smallest file size (1.5MB) was produced by Chrome using the method <i>Print - Save</i> while the largest file was produced by Firefox (4.4MB). A comparison of the file sizes produces by different browsers and methods is shown in Figure <ref>file-sizes</ref>
